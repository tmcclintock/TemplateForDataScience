# TemplateForDataScience
A template repository for AI/ML/DS projects. These types of projects contain
a mix of source code (models, metrics, pipeline scripts etc.) and analysis
(e.g. notebooks and plots). Structuring your repository like this one allows
for easy organization and best practices.

Source is maintained in the appropriate location (`insight` in this example),
while analyses would exist in the `notebooks` directory.
